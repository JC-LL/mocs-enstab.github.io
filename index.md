# L'équipe MOCS de Lab-STICC à l'ENSTA Bretagne

The members of the Lab-STICC MOCS Team at ENSTA Bretagne have been developing several tools that perform system-level
design and verification ([*OBP*](http://www.obpcdl.org/)), high-level synthesis (*Morphose*), and
low-level reconfigurable architecture modelling & design kit (*Madeo*).

Some research areas addressed by the MOCS team at ENSTA Bretagne are:

- formal safety and security verification and environment-driven formal verification
- high-level circuit synthesis
- reconfigurable system-on-chip design.

The MOCS team at ENSTA-Bretagne has exclusive access to a high-performance research
platform built using state-of-the art supercomputers, virtualisation, ICS, and reconfigurable architectures, which offers the
infrastructure for performing quantitative and qualitative evaluations on industrial case-studies.
